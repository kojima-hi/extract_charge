# Extract charges
Extracts ESP charges from Gaussian output, and construct arrangement of the charges of polymer.  
Order of atoms in the repeating segment is obeying on Gaussian order, and order of atom group adding ends is obeying Octa order (adding atoms at ends are added at the last of the segment).  

## Usage
See program help:

    $ python source/main.py -h

Example coming soon.
