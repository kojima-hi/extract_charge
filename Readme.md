# Extract ESP
Extracts ESP charges from Gaussian output, and construct arrangement of ESP charges of polymer.  
The order of the atoms in the segment is obeying Gaussian, and the order of atoms group adding ends is obeying Octa (adding atoms at ends are added at the last of the segment).  

## Usage
See program help:

    $ python source/main.py -h
